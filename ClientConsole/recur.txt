# How tasks recur
# Normal (non-strict): a new task is added when the previous task is completed. Default.
# Strict: a new task is added using the recurrence schedule, regardless of the status of the previous task. Specify
#   strict by placing + at the beginning of the recurrence specifier. Strict tasks automatically include a due 
#   date with the date they are added. Without it, multiple strict tasks in todo.txt would be duplicates.
#
# Format:
# <recurrence> <task>
#
# Accepted recurrence:
# daily: task    
# <day>: task
# month_day(st|rd|th): task
#  
# day       is one of "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday" or "sunday".
#           If a task needs to happen on two different days of the week, add two lines.
# month_day is the day of the month on which a task should recur 
#
# Examples:
# daily: run the dishwasher
# sunday: (A) Weekly review of projects list
# monday: Take out the trash @home
# +18th: Apply the dog's flea medicine
#
#
# Issues to deal with:
# If recur check only runs when console is running:
#  - Could be an arbitrary number of days between runs. Could mitigate by running periodically on own thread.
#  - If arbitrary number of days, have to manage start-of-week and start-of-month spans.
# If recur check runs on a schedule:
#  - Have to manage setup as a recurring task (cron or Windows scheduled task)
