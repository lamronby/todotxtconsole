Differences from Ben Hughes' ToDoLib

* Added SortType class for sorting tasks (needed)?

Task class

* Removed Raw property and associated logic
	* ToString method uses Task properties, does not use Raw
	* CompareTo method does property-by-property comparison
	* SetPriority is much simpler (just sets the Priority property)
* Added Integer Id property for use in specifying command-line commands
* CompletedDate property is a nullable DateTime instead of a string
* Contexts and Properties are stored without their designators (@ and +). They 
  are added in when needed (ToString and writing to file).
* Created separate ParseRaw method and moved parse logic out of constructor
	* Parse logic does not handle newer relative dates
* Added a Clone method, for facilitating task archive
* Converted all regex patterns constants to compiled static reeadonly Regex objects.
* Refactored ParseRaw to be more functional - allows for the entire parsing to be done in a single command.

TaskList class

* Refactored any logic that used Raw property.
* Added Console output by most Debug outputs to inform user.
* Added public properties for Priorities, Contexts, and Projects collections
* ReloadTasks: instead of creating new Task collection from the file, loads
  the file Tasks and compares with the existing collection. This facilitates
  using IDs for the tasks - the IDs will remain the same between file loads.
* Replaced Update method with Save method - Tasks are updated directly in the
  Task collection, then the collection is saved to disk and reloaded.
* Sort, FilterList, and Sort methods?
